# Project Name: PublicText

## Overview
PublicText is an experimental platform combining the power of Git's version control with the dynamic world of public discourse, web browsing, social bookmarking, wikis and blogging. It's designed to enhance how we manage, share, and interact with information in a transparent, collaborative online space.

This repository contains the Public Text template, which is a starting point for creating a new Public Text repository. It includes a basic directory structure, a README template, and a license. The template is designed to be cloned and personalized for your own Public Text repository.

The experiment is in early stages. 
Links to software repositories for tooling that works work these plaintext repositories to follow.

## Planned Features of the ecosystem

- **Plain text**: Using Markdown for simple, flexible content creation and editing. Tags and more complex metadata is stored using an open plaintext protocol. 
- **Immutable Public Records**: Leveraging Git for transparent, reliable record-keeping.
- **Consensus and Reputation Mechanisms**: Empowering community-driven content management and peer review.
- **Fluid Community Controls**: Flexibility with public, semi-public, and private content settings.
- **MetaWeb Commons Functionality**: A browser extension that integrates Git repositories that contain discussion and notes about web pages with the web browsing experience.
- **Social Bookmarking and Blogging**: Interactive platforms for content creation and sharing.
- **Desktop and Mobile UI**: Accessible interfaces for diverse devices, enhancing user interaction, content discovery and creation, and community engagement.
- **Web API**: A central conduit for seamless data integration and communication.
- **ActivityPub**: integration with the decentralized social networking protocol.
